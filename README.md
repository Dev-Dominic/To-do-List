# To-do-List

Basic ReactJS project that builds a to-do list.

## Objectives

The objective is to build a basic to-do list entirely using React Class
components, as well as, a more modern version making use of React function based
components and `hooks`.

Each build will contained in its own branch, while the master branch will
utilize the function based `hooks` version for the final product.
